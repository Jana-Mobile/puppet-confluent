## Description

finn-confluent is a puppet module to install, configure and run confluent.io distribution of kafka, zookeeper, schema-registry and rest service, on same or separate nodes in clusters. 

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
etc.), mention it here.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you might want to include an additional "Upgrading" section
here.

### Beginning with confluent

## Usage

## Reference

## Limitations

Code is written for Debian, tested on debian. Provisions are in place for expansion, but no effort is made to run on RedHat-style.
